Short Answer

1. Programmers use pseudocode to help brainstorm algorithms before actually typing it out in actual code. 
It helps to write the algorithm out in a way that is more understandable before figuring out how to create
 the code equivalent. 

2. If you run pseudocode nothing will happen because pseudocode is not actually code and is just brainstorming
 and clarification.
